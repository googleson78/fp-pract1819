# Useful general info

## Homeworks

Homework handover is done through the [Moodle] system we have at FMI.
For questions on homeworks you can (ordered by preference):

1. Use the mailing list.
2. Contact me directly (through one of the methods).

Public methods are best, because others can also read discussions there.

Your points on each homework and total points will be shown in a google doc, which doesn't exist as of yet.

## Grading?

| Type     | How many? | Points for each | Total |
| -------- |----------:| ---------------:|------:|
| Homework | 7         | 10              | 70    |
| Project  | 1         | 60              | 60    |

> But what about grades?

**>=110** points are a **6**
